With Python, itís easy to read strings from plain text filesófiles that are made up of 
only ASCII characters. (Although there are different types of text files, when I use the
term ìtext file,î I mean a plain text file.) Text files are a good choice for permanently
storing simple informa-tion, for a number of reasons. First, text files are cross-platform. 
A text file on a Windows machine is the same text file on a Mac and is the same text
file under Unix. Second, text files are easy to use. Most operating systems come with basic 
tools to view and edit them.

The program reads a simple text file I created on my system using a text editor. You can find 
the file on the companion website (www.courseptr.com/downloads) in the Chapter 7 folder; the 
file name is read_it.txt. 

Here are the contents of the file:

Line 1
This is line 2
That makes this line 3

You can find the code for the program on the companion website (www.courseptr.com/downloads) in 
the Chapter 7 folder; the file name is read_it.py:

print("Opening and closing the file.") 
text_file = open("read_it.txt", "r") 
text_file.close()

print("\nReading characters from the file.") text_file = open("read_it.txt", "r")
print(text_file.read(1))
print(text_file.read(5))
text_file.close()

print("\nReading the entire file at once.")
text_file = open("read_it.txt", "r") 
whole_thing = text_file.read() 
print(whole_thing)
text_file.close()

print("\nReading characters from a line.") text_file = open("read_it.txt", "r") print(text_file.readline(1))
print(text_file.readline(5))
text_file.close()

print("\nReading one line at a time.") text_file = open("read_it.txt", "r") print(text_file.readline())
print(text_file.readline())
print(text_file.readline())
text_file.close()

print("\nReading the entire file into a list.") text_file = open("read_it.txt", "r")
lines = text_file.readlines()
print(lines)
print(len(lines))
for line in lines:
    print(line) 
text_file.close()


print("\nLooping through the file, line by line.") text_file = open("read_it.txt", "r")
for line in text_file:
    print(line) 
text_file.close()
